This is the [Express](https://expressjs.com) [Hello world](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) example on [Render](https://render.com).

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://express.onrender.com](https://express.onrender.com).

## Deployment

See https://render.com/docs/deploy-node-express-app or follow the steps below:

Create a new web service with the following values:
  * Build Command: Use either `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
  * Start Command: Use either `npm start` (which runs `node app.js`) or `yarn start`

That's it! Your web service will be live on your Render URL as soon as the build finishes.
